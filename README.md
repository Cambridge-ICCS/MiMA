Model of an idealized Moist Atmosphere: Intermediate-complexity General Circulation Model with interactive water vapor and full radiation.

Still under heavy development, this model has been used by Martin Jucker for generating results for
the American Meteorological Society's Annual Meeting 2015,
the European Geosciences Unions General Assembly 2015,
and the American Meteorological Society's Conference on Atmospheric and Oceanic Fluid Dynamics 2015.
